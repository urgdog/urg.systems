# Field Stories

I worked as a field tech for a major ISP for years. If youâ€™ve ever done that kind of work,  
you already know: the field gives you stories.

Some are funny.  
Some are weird.  
Some make you question how anything in this world functions at all.  

This is my attempt to write them down, because I forget things now,  
and someone should probably get a laugh out of them.

All names have been anonymized for plausible deniability.

There may be cursing beyond this point.  

### **Actually, there will absolutely be cursing beyond this point.**

Proceed accordingly.
