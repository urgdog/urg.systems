# Field Stories

I used to work in the field doing telecommunications stuff.

Fixing stuff in the real world is fun and stressful.

Then I fixed stuff in headends where little red LEDs mean a lot of scary things.

tho some are red because everything is fine.

anyway here are some stories that happened.
