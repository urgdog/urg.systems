# 423

So way back in the day, we used to get paper printouts of our jobs,
like, actual carbon-copy work orders with those perforated holes on the sides.
Yes, I’m very old. (Okay, this was early in my career, so I’m not that old. Yet.)

Each work order had some vague label: "no picture," "slow data," "reception," whatever.
Not every job was a trouble call or install, you’d sometimes get oddball ones.
Disconnect for non-pay, pick up equipment after cancellation, that kind of thing.

One in my stack stood out:
"PICK UP EQUIPMENT - DECEASED."

Alright. Address is an old folks’ home. Apartment number’s listed.
Customer’s name. Serial numbers of the boxes to pick up. Same sort of format
for when someone cancels service. Kind of odd to specify 'deceased' in there,
in my opinion. Call me a corporate bueracrat, but the reason for cancellation 
isn't really my business? What's next - 'pick up equipment - incarceration'?
These are things I do not need to know to complete the job. Anyway, now I know,
and I cannot un-know. All it does is give me a small amount of context that might be useful
if anyone else in this chain cared, but for all experience stated, we will not place 
bets on that horse.

I figure, best case, they’ve already pulled the gear and left it at the front desk.
I REALLY don't want to go in and start riffling around a dead guy's apartment
to take some cable boxes. I'm pretty sure that's how you get cursed or arrested.
Or both, I guess. In the theoretical galactic handbook of operational compliance,
"Don't take stuff from dead people's apartments" is one of the rules. I think that's
a rule. In this book which everyone and nobody has read, I'm certain
we can all agree that this is a rule. Naturally, there are exceptions if you
know the person, or are close to them. These exceptions and lienencies are
not afforded to the cable guy. Breaking and Entering is not on my list of to-do's.

So I head into the building, which is bustling with people waiting for shuttles,
just hanging out. It’s quiet. Oddly quiet, for how many people are shuffling around.
Naturally, I don't want to be the crude brute, "EY! SOMEONE DIE? I GOTTA GET THAT
TV BOX!". Obviously not my brand. Contextual sensitivity, situational awareness,
you know. All that stuff.

So I do the respectful discreet thing - I walk up to the front desk, fold my work
order over so it shows the name, and "DECEASED" - less information to absorb.
I show it to the lady at the front desk and quietly say,
"Hey, I’m here for Mr. Smith - just picking up some cable boxes.
Do you happen to have them here?"
I tap on the paper, indicating the name, and the "DECEASED" in giant, bold,
monospace dot matrix print.

The woman at the desk glances at the paper and goes,
> "Go on up."

I pause.
> "Uh... is anyone there? I mean..." (gestures intesnely at the DECEASED bit)

She waves me off.
> "Yeah, yeah. Just go on up."

Okay. Thanks for paying attention. I’m not about to explain the ethics
of apartment looting in the lobby. Maybe I’ll run into a
maintenance guy who can help. Maybe there's someone living there still?
Maybe the surviving partner didn't want the TV service? Is this all a clerical
error for an account change and I'm going to callously bring up the late husband
to an elderly widow? My mind is spinning with contextual oddities to prepare
to navigate.

So I head up to the fourth floor. 423.

The place is huge. Multiple towers. Random connector hallways on certain floors.
Layout makes no sense. The signage is awful.

On 4, I see:  
> 402-411 ←  
> 412-421 →  

423? Nowhere. I walk the whole floor. Dead end both directions.
I double-check the work order. Yup. 423. Double check the address, because
weirder stuff has happened. Yep, I'm at the right place, 100%.

Okay, I’ve done this game before. Usually the apartment numbers are stacked, 
so I drop to 3 to scout the layout, thinking maybe I can work out where 323
is and triangulate vertically. Maybe the third floor has better signage.

Sure enough:  
> 300-311 ←  
> 312-323 →  

Hey! 323! If I can find that, then I just go up from there... and in theory,
I should be able to find it. Maybe this is the floor where there's a connector.
Maybe 423 exists in another tower, or... I don't know. I really want to find 323.
That will give me at least a clue. So I’m walking, studying the architecture,
basically trying to reverse-engineer non-euclidean blueprints in my head. Perhaps
I'm studying a bit too much, like I'll discover the seam between the floral wallpaper
and the chair rail down the entire hallway is where 423 will unfold from,
like some kind of dimensional rift. Of course, this attention to detail and
deep thought does not go unnoticed.

Here she comes.  
***turn other way. leave now. gaze sharp like stick.***  
An older lady. Moving slow. Watching me like I’m casing the joint.

She hits me with the inevitable:
"What room are you looking for?"

God damnit.

I can’t say a random number - that might be her unit, and 
everyone knows everyone here, so my chances aren't good of
spewing a random number to not cause chaos in this lady's life.
I can’t explain that she lives in an MC Escher drawing. Did I see what room
she came from? Can I make a guess as to not her apartment? Does it matter?
Can I just say it doesn't matter? No, that's worse. I've gotta say something,
I'm standing here like a cow contemplating calculus.

***it only 0.8 seconds. it ok, not look dumb yet. talk now tho.***  

So I just say:

"423."

She frowns.
"This is the third floor."

"I know."
We pass each other. Her judgment delivered. My competence
solidly questioned.

Anyway, I find 323. It does exist, and it should have been right where I 
thought it should have been on four. I think? I don't remember. I have to double
check, because I've gone this far, I can't quit now.  

Go back up. Nope. Still no 423. Nothing. No unlabeled door. There is a stairway,
with badge access though. God damnit. Maybe it's in there? I hope not, those
are usually the mental health care areas, and that's a whole pile of complexities there I don't
want to deal with right now, and definitely not for the amount of time I've budgeted
for this simple "pick up equipment" job. I should have been done long ago.

Time to go back to the front desk and try diplomacy again.

"Hey," I ask the front desk lady, "are you sure there’s a 423?
I’ve looked all over. Is it in this building? I saw badge access up there, is it
badge access only?"

She looks at me like I've just asked her how to tell up from down.
"Uh... yeah 423 is here, just go up.", rivaling the dismissive venom only matched
by teenagers.

"Do you happen to have any cable boxes? Black boxes? Maybe maintenance picked them up?"

She sighs with a vitriol that could make steel melt. Calls maintenance.
Explains, loudly, that some guy can’t find room four-twenty-three with the tone
that makes it clear that her opinion of my intellectual capacity as a human being is 
slightly below pond scum. I’m standing right there. Thanks.
Batting a thousand here on perceptions of competence.

Maintenance guy comes up, we head to the elevators. At this point I wouldn't
be surprised if he pulled on a sconce and 423 appeared. As I'm explaining
the situation, he nods and goes: "Ohhh, Mr. Smith! Yeah, he passed.
Mrs. Smith moved up to 504 a few months ago. We turned a few of those units
on the end into a gym after that."

...

Of course you did.

So now I’m in a pickle. I’m not gonna knock on a grieving widow’s door
and be like "hey I’m here to repo your dead husband’s DVR." Not a chance.

I could just do nothing, and let it be "not complete".
But I also don’t want to leave this work order open for someone else to
rediscover this whole mess.

I get an idea. I call dispatch.

> "Can you ping the equipment listed for 423?"
 
> "Yeah, we can reach all of it."

Perfect. That means she probably just moved it upstairs and it all still works.

> "Alright... Do we have an account for 504?"

> "Yep. Mrs. Smith. Basic cable. No equipment."

> "Cool. Transfer all that gear to her account. Cancel 423. No charge."

> "Okay... hang on... :keyboard noises:... All set. That cancelled this work order
because there's no equipment to pick up."

Great, so I don't even get credit for detangling this. Whatever. I could argue
to turn it into a transfer, but that would mean I'd need a signature or
a bunch of paperwork... And Mrs. Smith would probably be charged for nothing.
Forget it. Get me out of here.

> "Ok, thanks. All set then."

Closure. Excellent. No confrontation. No awkward knock. Relief, at last.

Just a quiet system update and a database brought back into alignment.

As I’m heading out, who do I run into in the lobby?

Yup. Third floor lady.

"Did you ever find the room you were looking for?"

Hey, she already thinks I'm missing some marbles, so let's give her the real answer:
"Kind of. Almost? Ultimately; yes. Thank you."

And I walk out.
Job complete. Boxes accounted for. Zero credit.  
Condolences to Mrs. Smith.
