# Projects & Experiments

Sometimes I do things. Mostly I like doing nothing- 
which is why I do a lot of things, so I can do nothing later.

One day I'll get it all sorted out and actually do nothing for real.

In the meantime, here are some projects I've worked on in the neverending pursuit of laziness.
