# Homelabbing - Self-inflicted Resilience Training

Breaking things is a great way to learn.

Actually, fixing them is the part where you learn. Breaking them is easy.

Critical point: ensure fix/break ratio is greater than 1.

**More formally, the F/B ratio:**

```
F = quantity of fixed things
B = quantity of things you've touched
```
This is critical math, you must understand it deeply.

I have a little homelab where I valiantly attempt to keep the F/B ratio up.

As you've probably noted already, the best way to do that is to keep "B" 
as low as possible. The problem is I can't un-touch things, so I must increase
"F". Which requires touching things, which increases "B". I told you the math
would get complicated.

I do this to see if things will, in fact, work the way I think they should (they do not).
Other times it's learning that yes, that thing CAN boot at 80 VAC. (Kinda).

Behold! My standard stuff:

- WireGuard tunnels between multiple physical locations
- Dynamic DNS + LTE backups for conditional failover
- UDM Pro acting as the vanguard of peace between "prod" and "experiments"
    - (if you have a WFH partner, you have prod, tread carefully)
- ~80+ Cat6e throughout the house. I should have pulled more.

Lab things:
- ~a space heater~ Dell R610 with VMware, and an ancient supermicro running proxmox (battling to the death)
- Intel NUCs, a few of em... I don't remember what they're doing. I think that one's important.
- Mikrotiks running BGP because... I mean they can, how cool is that?
- Digital Loggers (IP power controller), and a few UPSs- and a lot of velcro.

One may see this as a graveyard of ancient gear that should be put to rest.

I see it as a ritual site to extract knowledge from these forsaken chips. They
will earn their rest. But not yet.

Why do all this?

It's good to dive in just to stay sharp.

If you haven't experienced the full ride of: 
> "I know nothing, none of this makes sense."

(followed by)

> "I am the smartest person alive!"

(followed by)

> "I am dumber than pond scum."

You should probably build a lab. It will humble and enlighten. It doesn't need to be expensive.

You don't need a certification, you don't need a degree, you don't need to "be smart".

You just need to have curiosity, stubbornness, and yes, a few dollars for these things.

The rollercoaster is worth the price.
