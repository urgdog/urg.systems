# Thunderdoming
A lot of project frameworks look goofy to me.

I have my own "framework", called "Thunderdome Kanban".

It's trash, it's stupid, but it's just "cognitive function in a kanban".
which is why it works for me, because I have cognitive function. Maybe your team
doesn't. That's ok. I get it, org structures are different. But this works for me.

### Workflow Overview
- Backlog  
- Requirement Analysis  
- Refinement *(aka The Thunderdome)*  
- Todo  
- In Progress  
- Testing  
- Done  

## Backlog / Input: Reality Sucks; Let's Fix It

You want complaints- the unstructured, vague type.
Create tickets for these to shield the team's time.
If the request is lousy, it gets nuked into Will Not Implement. If it's a maybe, keep it.
It can age well too. What was true 2 years ago may not be true today.

Sometimes the worst ideas have some nuggets of awesome.

## Requirement Analysis: Beating Clarity out of Ambiguity
Turn "i want better data" into something usable. e.g., 
"RSSI, CINR, GPS coordinates, on a 24 hour cycle, queryable on my phone."

This usually comes from understanding the business, and one  long pause
where the request is calcified into reality when the target of your inquisition
relinquishes what they actually meant to say in the first place. It's an art.

Get the finished thought onto a silver platter for your team.

## Refinement: The Thunderdome
I think normal people call this "grooming". I call it idea-knife-fights
until they're ready. Or, if you want to be nice in front of execs, "Thunderdoming".

The idea does battle to get to a stable path forward. As engineers, we 
facilitate their battle. Remember, this isn't engineer vs engineer, this is 
idea vs idea. Super important to get this through- we're not here to prove
who's smartest, cleverest, etc. 

Poke the idea, question assumptions, look for re-use or potential landmines.

Never be too proud to say 'I don't know'.

If someone acts like they know everything, you should probably laugh loudly
at them. They're jackasses.

Anyway, if the task has a path that makes sense, it moves to Todo.

If it gets beat up a little too much, maybe it goes back to requirement analysis.
That's ok. No penalty, it's fine. You get to learn too. That means you get
feedback on what you need to truly silver-platter up the ideas. It's a good thing.

## Execution: Just get it done, but don't be stupid about it
Once it's in todo, it can be claimed (probably could have been claimed inherently
in the thunderdome too)

Engineers can and should push back or pivot mid-stream if the original plan
turns out to be bad. That's learning. It's ok. Just make sure it gets communicated.

We're not here to do the stuff we already know how to do.

Sometimes a ticket gets blocked. That's fine.  
Sometimes it becomes "Will Not Implement". This is also fine.  

Learning what not to do is just as important as "doing something".  
Sometimes more important.

I'm not going to describe 'will not implement', 'testing', or 'done'.

## isnt this just pm'ing yourself
Yeah, it is. Is this whole thing arrogance? A little, but mostly it's just ownership.
Know the system, the players, the business.

Are there pms that can mesh with this with real domain insight? Yeah. A
worthwhile partner, for sure.

## 2 hard 2 care, y bother
yeah pretty much it's "do everything yourself and get no exec vis for 3x the work".

Nailed it. That's the issue. Caring sucks. It's hard.

In a place that focuses on ticket count, this will flop.

And sure, don't forget to throw together some slide decks to get wins for the
quarter to show progress.

And if you can't slop a deck together to show killer impact,
and the results aren't screaming louder than some vague deck,
always be open to the idea that you aren't as good as you thought.

at least I'm not chasing ticket velocity.
