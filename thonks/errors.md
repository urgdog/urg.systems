# Urg Totem: Error Say, 'Cable Not Plugged'. Humans Say, 'System Broken.'

In olden days, when Urg was a young shaman, he want to share all knowledge
with everyone. Very noble. Sometimes tho, ppl don't want all knowledge.
Is ok- not everyone likes to know history since time started. Very helpful
for troubleshooting, not helpful for finishing things before ale-o-clock.

So, Urg make programs- sometimes they have errors! Can't control that because
humans interact with programs. That's the point! But humans are weird and
unpredictable. 

When error, you say what to do, how to fix, how to troubleshoot. Sometimes
problem is Urg's problem, sometimes it's humans problem. (most time it's
human problem).

So error log shows all the truth:

> INFO: MAKING DEVICE GO  
> INFO: TRYING TO CONNECT TO DEVICE  
> WARN: RETRY ONCE MORE...  
> ERROR: DEVICE NOT WORK. CHECK CABLE (GREEN). DID YOU PLUG IN GREEN CABLE?  

Urg see this. Urg understand. Check cable! Green one!

But young shamans... they not see last line. Now, clever young shamans 
copy paste all errors for Urg to see, and say "Urg! Help! I have error!"

Urg reads error, and think, "Urg must broken it, something very bad."

Nope, young shaman not plug in green cable! WHY inflict pain like this?

Urg has a theory about this, and maybe it help other shamans:
humans don't read when scared because if not green lights, heart go fast.
Must make green light, so finger go faster than brain and say "Help!".

So, Urg's tribe try new thing: we summon ancient demon from mid 1990's.  
Is forbidden in some places, but Urg makes new rules. Is ok, Urg knows this demon.
Not wise demon. Not noble demon. Hateful spirit. But has power. So much power.

You can summon demon if you want to see:

<div class="clippy-summon" onclick="document.getElementById('clippy-art').style.display = (document.getElementById('clippy-art').style.display === 'block') ? 'none' : 'block';">
⚠️⚠️⚠️ summon forbidden demon (click here)⚠️⚠️⚠️
</div>
<div id="clippy-art" class="clippy-art">
<pre class="clippy-wiggle"> 
   __                
  /  \        _____________   
  |  |       /             \  
  @  @       | IT LOOKS    |  
  || ||      | LIKE GREEN  |  
  || ||   <--| CABLE NOT   |  
  |\_/|      | PLUGGED IN. |    
  \___/      \_____________/  
</pre>

AAA WHY DID YOU RELEASED HORRIBLE DEMON
hah is ok just kidding its only picture, urg wouldn't do that to you.

scary tho rite?

</div>

So we put demon in logs. Right in logs! How un-engineer-shaman-like.

But! What happen? When Clippy appear, human see. human pause.
humans may even feel little shame. Is ok.

Then humans plug in cable.

Victory!

Urg lessons that error not need be more info, sometimes less info is better.
Sometimes message need hurt a little. Shame is strong medicine.

If humans not read error, maybe try summon ancient demon.

But do not over-do! His power is diminished with use.

But if pain is high, he may be solution. Clippy redirect pain away from 
tribe of shamans.
