# Windows shhhh Checklist  

(side note: Seeing a weird "Install Driver to Show Hardware" when installing Windows 11?
Try a different USB stick - a different brand particularly.)

## Taskbar & Start Menu

  `Right-click taskbar >> News and Interests >> Turn off`

  `Settings >> Personalization >> Taskbar >> Widgets >> Off`

- Start Menu omg stfu  
  `Settings >> Personalization >> Start`  
  Turn off:
  -   Show recently added apps  
  -   Show most used apps  
  -   Show suggestions occasionally in Start  

## Notifications & Popups

- Disable App Notifications  
  `Settings >> System >> Notifications`  
  OFF (might need to toggle):
  - Tips, tricks, and suggestions

  `Settings >> Privacy & security >> General`  
  Turn off:

-  Disable Bing in Start Menu  
  *(Requires a registry edit - not linking here, because it changes all the time)*

-   Clean Up Lock Screen  
  `Settings >> Personalization >> Lock screen`  
  Set background to Picture, not Windows Spotlight
