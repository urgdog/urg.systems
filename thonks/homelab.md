# Recursive competence: how to learn that you can learn

Breaking things is a great way to learn.

Actually, fixing them is the part where you learn. Breaking them is easy.

You can ensure you are learning by using this formula that is absolutely real
and not made up and useless.

**Formally, the F/B ratio:**

```
F = quantity of fixed things
B = quantity of things you've touched
```

Ensure fix/break ratio is as high as possible.

The best way to keep this ratio high is to keep "B" as low as possible.

New problem: How can you un-touch things? 

I don't think this is possible. So, we must increase "Fixed" things.
Which means increasing "Broken" things (also known as "Touched" things.)

A complete solution has never been devised, and that's how the internet was born.

Warning:

**If you have a WFH partner, you have production network! Tread carefully!**

You should probably make a router or strongly segment between:
- blood-ritual knowledge extraction site (lab)  
 and 
- land of uptime (production) where partner can WFH safely.

Do not become "A Problem" layered atop "ISP problems".

A wise shaman will monitor, be aware, and inform proactively.

Not to deflect blame.
But to ensure stability of their realm. This also will prevent you from 
catching the eyebrow raise of doom when purchasing a 20 amp breaker and
100 ft of romex when on what started as a gardening trip to home depot.

You don't need to spend thousands on a lab. My gear is ancient, and half of
it is doing something useful. The other half is eagerly awaiting abuse.

Why do all this?

I don’t know, honestly. Sometimes it’s satisfying to spend too long making an
LED blink. Or getting a single ping to work. It feels stupid. But it’s not.
More realistically, the answer is probably chasing the lows and highs of:

> "I know nothing, none of this makes sense."

(followed by)

> "I am the smartest person alive!"

(followed by)

> "I am dumber than pond scum."

This is what makes soft, failure-fearing folk into tough shamans that can stare
down the uncertainty beast and laugh. You've broken better, and fixed worse. Most importantly:

you've figured out that you know how to figure it out.
