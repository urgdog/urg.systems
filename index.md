# urgent systems

If you've found yourself here, I'm not entirely sure why- but welcome.

This site exists because I've spent years working with infrastructure, systems and people. Most of 
what passes for strategy or improvement in those spaces is pretty messy, so I try to distill it down
to something less stupid.

What you'll find here:

- Posts about things I've broken or fixed
- Thoughts about random things I find are interesting
- Eventually some comedy gold stories from my days of old

You may even find a small sliver of wisdom.

Mostly, this is a place for the things too real or weird to go anywhere else. My hope is that someone
stumbles on this and think, "ah, not a bad idea, I should do that," and saves themselves some pain.

- [Projects](/projects/) - Things I've built or broken in name of progress. Slightly more polished.
- [Notes & Thoughts](/notes/) - I unleash my inner goblin brain.
- Field Stories - Not yet built. Not sure if text will do those justice.
