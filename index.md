# urgent systems

If you've landed here, you're probably trying to figure out how I think.
You've come to the right place then- this place is mostly about infrastructure, 
systems, and how organizations quietly fail, or hit the mark. Welcome.

This site exists because most of what passes for strategy or 
process in technical organizations is deeply confused. I’ve spent 
nearly two decades building, fixing, and fighting through those 
systems — and this is where I try to distill the lessons down to 
something less stupid, without buzzword nonsense.

What you’ll find here:
- Posts about things I’ve broken or fixed
- Thoughts about random things I find are interesting
- Eventually some comedy gold stories from my days of old

You may even find a small sliver of wisdom- or at least a question
to ask that helps avoids the cataclysm.

This is not a portfolio, it's not sanitized- it's just bizarre 
edge cases, the "why are we even doing this?" kind of thinking.
My hope is that someone can stumble across this and think:
"Ah, that's not a bad idea. I should try that," and saves
themselves some pain- or at least has a laugh.

> There’s a lot of things to worry about.

- [Projects](/projects/) - Things I've built or broken in name of progress. Slightly more polished.
- [Notes & Thoughts](/notes/) - I unleash my inner goblin brain.
- Field Stories - Not yet built. Not sure if text will do those justice.
