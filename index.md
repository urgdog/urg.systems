# urg systems

I'm not sure why this exists. It started as a "can I make a website without
it being total trash" and now lands somewhere between "kinda" and "who cares".

Things I do:
- I think about things
- I get annoyed they don't work good
- I break (then sometimes fix.)

Computer things, house things, social things,
finance things, and even organizational company things, and sometimes how
none of it will really matter in a few hundred million years.

But we should try anyway tho, right?

Probably.

Because not trying new stuff is boring. What else are you gonna do?

Anyway, I don't think I have all the answers. And you can find all the 
answers out there anyway.

Maybe one day someone will read this and think:

> "Huh. Neat brain idea."

It will prolly be me because I am old and forget all the time.
If it's not me, that's incredible.

Hello, other creature.

> Unaffiliated with anything.  

> Thereâ€™s a lot of things to worry about.
