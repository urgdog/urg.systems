# urg systems

things i do:
- think about things
- get annoyed they don't work good
- break (then sometimes fix)

computer things, house things, social things,
finance things, org things, and sometimes how
none of it will really matter in a few hundred million years.

we should try anyway tho, right?

not trying new stuff is boring. what else are you gonna do?

i don't have all the answers, and you can find all the 
answers out there anyway.

maybe one day someone will read this.

it will prolly be me because I am old and forget.  
if you are not me, that's incredible.
