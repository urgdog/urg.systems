# urgent systems

I build and scale systems that didn't want to cooperate. I blend the physical, virtual, and 
human elements into something that works.

This site is not a portfolio. It's not an upskilling blog. It's not SEO-optimized, and absolutely not for
for tech influencers.

If you've found yourself here, I'm not entirely sure why- but welcome. Maybe you want to understand how I think.
Maybe you're just wandering. Maybe you had a typo. Either way:

There are stories and insights here, and a few failures. You may even find a small sliver of wisdom.
Mostly, this is a place for the things too real or weird to go anywhere else.

- [Projects](/projects/) - Things I've built, broken, or debugged all in name of progress. Slightly more polished.
- [Notes & Thoughts](/notes/) - Unhinged goblin energy. Tread carefully.
- Field Stories - Not yet built. When it is, some real chaos will come out of here.
