# urgent systems

This site is (mostly) about infrastructure, systems, and how they silently fail- 
or hit the mark. It exists because most technical writings are by people who've never had
to assemble a shielded RJ45 while standing on an icy rooftop at midnight.

I've spent two decades building, fixing, and fighting real systems of all kinds.
What's here is distilled aftermath.

What you'll find:
- Posts about things I’ve broken or fixed
- Thoughts about weird stuff I find interesting
- Stories from the field

You may even find a little wisdom.  
Or at least the right question to ask before the next thing blows up.

Perhaps one day, someone may stumble across this and think:

> "Huh. That's a good idea, I should try that."

Odds are it will be me, in the future. But if it's someone else -  that's
pretty cool too.

> Unaffiliated with anything.  
> There’s a lot of things to worry about.

- [Projects & Experiments](/projects/) - Things I've built or broken in name of progress. Slightly more polished.
- [Notes & Thoughts](/notes/) - Musings, technical notes, grievances.
- [Field Stories](/stories/) - Minimal dignity. Be warned.
