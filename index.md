# urgent systems

If you've landed here, you're probably trying to figure out how I think.

Good. You're in the right place.

This site is (mostly) about infrastructure, systems, and how they silently fail- 
or hit the mark. It exists because most of these discussions about technical
strategy are buzzword-laden and written by people who've never had
to assemble a shielded RJ45 while standing on an icy rooftop at midnight.

I've spent two decades building, fixing, and fighting real systems of all kinds.
What's here is distilled aftermath, for better or worse.

What you'll find:
- Posts about things I’ve broken or fixed
- Thoughts about weird stuff I find interesting
- Stories from the field, all true.

You may even find a little wisdom.  
Or at least the right question to ask before the next thing blows up.

This is not a portfolio.

It's not sanitized.

It's the weird stuff, it's the edge cases, the "why are we even doing this?"
 kind of thinking.

If one person stumbles across this and thinks:

> "Huh. That's a good idea, I should try that."

Then this was all worth putting online.

> Unaffiliated with anything.  
> Responsible for nothing and everything.  
> There’s a lot of things to worry about.

- [Projects & Experiments](/projects/) - Things I've built or broken in name of progress. Slightly more polished.
- [Notes & Thoughts](/notes/) - I unleash my inner goblin brain.
- [Field Stories](/stories/) - Technical truth. Minimal dignity.
