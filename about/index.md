Why Urg?

idk. why are you?

Oh, you actually want to know?

k, I'm a network and systems nerd that knows how to climb a telephone pole and work in that
weird brick and barbed wire building that you drive past every day that you've
never acknowledged until this moment. That's "where the internet comes from".

I do internet stuff, systems stuff, coding things, systems stuff, leadership things.

all to make it not hurt as much, and maybe get a laugh.
