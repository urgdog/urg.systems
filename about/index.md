Oh, you actually want to know?

k, I'm a network and systems nerd that lives in that weird concrete building
surrounded by barbed wire that you've seen a million times and never
acknowledged until this moment. That's "where the internet comes from". Hello.

I do internet stuff, systems stuff, coding things, systems stuff, leadership things.

all to make it not hurt as much, and maybe get a laugh.
