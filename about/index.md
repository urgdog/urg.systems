# About

Why Urg?

Why? I don't know. Why are you?

See?

Harder to answer than you thought.

Maybe you did answer. Perhaps you are more clever. This is good.

I have nothing else to say right now. Actually I'm just re-factoring this whole
dumb site because it felt like a vague stupid-ass linkedin portfolio wannabe 
trying to be walking the line of being acceptable but not acceptable.

This site isn't acceptable or normal.

Neither am I. And that's ok, because both are.

Are what?

idk, they just are.

Temporarily anyway.

Look, I don't need to rationalize my existence to you, nor do you of me.

Oh, you actually want to know?

k, I'm a network and systems nerd that knows how to climb a telephone pole and work in that
weird brick and barbed wire building that you drive past every day that you've
never acknowledged until this moment. That's "where the internet comes from". It's neat.

so I do internet stuff, systems stuff, coding things, systems stuff, leadership things.
sometimes I let my inner orc take the wheel here. You'll know when he shows up.

all to make things not suck as much as they do, and maybe get a laugh.

w/e look if you want some pseudo feel-good depression bait about thought leadership
go to linkedin.

oh man can you imagine if linkedin didn't exist? that'd be neat - 
cuz I'll definitely not update this.

Wanna know something horrible?

ofc you do.

Are you on a Windows machine? CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + WIN + L.

Yeah... Not ideal, right? Kinda real bad, in a systemic way. Has odd implications
beyond what I want to get into here. Or it's just some dumb thing someone was 
padding their jira high score with.

Entirely useless. On both accounts.

But here I am, talking about it.

Oh well.
