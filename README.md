 # urg.systems

This repo contains the source for [urg.systems](https://urg.systems),
a minimalist site for infrastructure and systems thoughts, and field stories.

> Mostly a place to put my weird ideas and stories 
that don't belong anywhere else.

You probably want the site, not the code.

And by "code", I mean: - it's just a Jekyll static site.
