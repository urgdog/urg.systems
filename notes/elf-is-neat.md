# $200 Scam and Submarine Communications

So I saw an ad for a $200 "voice-to-skull blocker". One of those overpriced LED+battery
scams, sold to people clearly in distress.

Now, I usually try to understand the actual claims behind pseudoscience. Not because I think they're valid, but I want to know WHY they're wrong, so I engage with the premise just to understand. Sometimes bad ideas beget good ones.

In this case, the concept seemed to be: electromagnetic fields at the "right frequencies"
can make you hear voices inside your head. Not a single frequency or number listed.
Just a slop of science-sounding words.

That did get me thinking- I've studied music, I've worked with RF. Hertz is my dude.

Humans can hear **air pressure** changes from 20-20,000 Hz- that's the average human auditory range.

But what about electromagnetic frequencies in that range? Especially ~20 Hertz- what could generate that?
That would be an absurdly long wavelength. ~15,000 kilometers per cycle- bigger than Earth's diameter.

My first thought was: "well, I guess you'd only see that generated from some
deep space objects or something, can't build an antenna that does that."

Apparently, humans are clever little monsters, and we CAN generate those frequencies.

It's called ELF/ULF (Extremely/Ultra Low Frequency). It's used for submarine
communication. Look up [Project Sanguine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sanguine) if you're
in a wikipedia rabbit hole mood but I'll give a brief summary.

These wavelengths are so long and attenuate so little they can push right through seawater- but
the problem is you need a monstrously huge antenna and tons of power to generate even a whisper of
a signal. But some clever apes did it- and the antenna isn't even a loop of copper;
it's Earth itself. How cool is that?

Cooler than a $200 LED, I'll tell you that.

Just to be clear, none of what I've described has ANYTHING to do with hearing voices or mind control
or any of that pseudoscience.

Yes, both sound and EMF use Hertz. Thatâ€™s a neat coincidence, not a conspiracy.

No, it does not mean that EMF in that range will make your auditory cortex do things. That is not how RF
propagation or biology works. At all.

The scam is absolute garbage, and it's frustrating to see that it conflates genuinely interesting science
by wrapping it up in manipulative, exploitative trash. 

People who buy this stuff need help, not a placebo with a 99.9% margin.

Snake oil nonsense >> I wonder... >> Earth antenna >> Impressive.
