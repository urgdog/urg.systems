# Thunderdoming
A lot of project frameworks look like theatre to me. Theatre's fine and all,
but keep it out of my workflow.

I have my own "framework", informally called "Thunderdome Kanban".

I didn't get this from a slide deck, nor was this handed down from some PM deity.
It absolutely would not pass a "scaled agile maturity" workshop. It's just what
I've seen actually work and is grounded in reality. If you really wanted
to get analytical about it, this is just "cognitive function turned into a kanban board".

I can say that it works, because it's built around what eng. teams actually need:
clarity, trust that they're not idiots, and time to focus. It's optimized for results,
not ceremony.

### Workflow Overview
- Backlog  
- Requirement Analysis  
- Refinement *(aka The Thunderdome)*  
- Todo  
- In Progress  
- Testing  
- Done  

## Intake: Complaints are Gold

I don't need a polished pitch for a project. I want complaints- the messy,
unstructured, vague, "this sucks but I don't have a good answer" type. These
are usually much closer to reality anyway.

I create tickets for these to shield the team's time. If the request is lousy,
it gets nuked into Will Not Implement. If it's a maybe, I keep it. Context
ages well- what was true 2 years ago may not be true today.

And sometimes, the worst sounding ideas have some nuggets of awesome in them.
It's worth writing them down, even briefly.

## Requirement Analysis: Beating Clarity out of Ambiguity
This is where you turn "we need better data" into something usable. e.g., 
"better" becomes "RSSI, CINR, GPS coordinates, on a 24 hour cycle".

This doesn't come from guessing, it comes from asking a bunch of clarifications,
understanding the actual business, and one uncomfortable pause where the request
is calcified into reality by the requester finally vocalizing what they actually meant.

This is done before my guys ever see the ticket or hear about it. In my mind,
if they're not getting it served on a silver platter, I've already failed.

## Refinement: The Thunderdome
I think normal people call this "grooming", I call it the Thunderdome.

This is where tickets, (some even created by the engineers themselves)
do battle to refine the shape of what actually is going to happen.

We poke the idea, question assumptions, look for re-use or potential landmines.
I'll pitch a starting path based on existing tools or known patterns, or sometimes
a crazy idea or even just a question. I'm not too proud to say I don't know about
all technical details on earth. (By the way, if you do encounter one of those folks-
run. Or laugh. They're lying.)

So if the task survives the thunderdome, it moves to Todo.

If it gets beat up a little too much, maybe it goes back to requirement analysis.
That's ok- no penalty, no hurt pride. Just a better understanding.

Keep the ego at the door for the thunderdome. It's not harsh - unless you show
up married to a bad idea.

## Execution: Not a Conveyor Belt - More Like a Workshop
Once a ticket survives and makes it to Todo, it's live. It can be assigned,
claimed, worked on, and moved to In Progress.

From there, engineers can push back or pivot mid-stream if the original plan
turns out to be a dead end or uncovers further landmines. That's learning. It's
ok. We're not here to do the stuff we already know how to do. Don't worship the
ticket. Solve the problem. The ticket is just a record of what's been moving
forward.

Sometimes a ticket gets blocked. That's fine. Sometimes it becomes "Will Not Implement".
This is also fine. Learning what not to do is just as important as pushing code.
Sometimes more important.

Don’t chase ticket velocity.

Chase clarity, leverage, and progress that compounds.

## A Note on Product Management
When it comes to product direction, this vibe may sound like rogue director
behavior. Allow me to clarify- I don’t mind working with PMs when they bring it.

If you show up with weak PM sauce, know that I’m an Italian grandma of PM sauce.
I know how to do it so it comes out good. Even if I explain it, it won’t be as
good. Best thing you can do? Watch, appreciate, and maybe learn a little.

This sounds like arrogance, but it's just ownership. I know the system.
And when I’ve worked with the rare PM who brings real context, domain insight,
and decision-making clarity? Yeah, that's a good dish.

Rare partnerships indeed. You'll know when it happens.

Until then, I build systems that don’t depend on product theater to function.

## How I Track Success
I don’t do story points. We don’t measure burndown charts. I don’t care how
many tickets someone closes per week.

What I track is whether we’re closing meaningful work quarter over quarter.
I EXPECT ticket creation to outpace ticket closure. That means we’re absorbing
pain at a maximum rate.

As long as the completed side reflects high-leverage delivery: things that
simplify systems, reduce fragility, or eliminate toil; we’re winning. We don’t
need synthetic metrics when the real progress is obvious.

You'll be able to feel it, and you can see your message history tilt 
slightly more in control.

## What This Really Does
It quietly fixes the foundation under the org without fanfare.

## Why It Works — and When It Doesn’t
All great talk right, cool story. "You think this is smarter than agile?". Nope.
It's dumber. Which is why this works. This is more a philosophy
than a framework. This assumes a high-agency, high-trust team. If you have a team
that needs handholding in every task, this is foolish.

If you create the space and culture for it? It cranks.

New folks can feel a little “thrown to the wolves” - and that’s okay. The team
catches them. There’s camaraderie in figuring it out. And there’s pride in
seeing someone go from “I’m lost” to “I figured it out, all set.”

This philosophy will not scale to 50 teams without dilution. Of course.
It scales insight. It teaches people how to think, not just how to click.

## Final Thought
This isn’t a framework. It’s a philosophy. It’s built on the idea that you can’t
fix systems with ceremonies. You fix them by teaching people to ask better
questions and take ownership without theater.

If that means a little chaos at the edges? So be it. As long as there's
enough discipline to keep it from spiraling, it'll be fine.

It means engineering aligns to the org because the process finally reflects reality.

### Final Thought, The Sequel
Yes, this does not create "easy pathways for executive oversight". You'll
probably need to make some slide decks to get wins for the quarter to show
progress. If someone’s hammering you for ticket velocity in a high-agency department, the real problem isn’t your workflow.

It’s that they’ve mistaken dashboards for delivery.

You want real solutions? Try it out. Watch what gets delivered - and feel what
stops breaking.
