# Field Is Systems

Without all the cables on poles, hornet-infested handholes, satellite dishes
attached with a single mighty bolt, none of this works.

Software is fun and all, but it's running on top of some dirty, rusted out
spider-filled lie.

I started in the field, carrying a ladder just about as heavy as me, 
crawling under decks in what was *definitely* mud and *not* four inches of
racoon poop.

Every call was a black box. No home runs. Always:
> "The wiring is fine, our electrician is the best."  
> Yes, of course, I can tell by the RadioShack fittings and 568-FU wiring scheme.  

By the way, you've got 50 minutes. Figure it out and fix it.

I loved it.

Because fundamentally? It's the dumb version of systems training.

You learn things like:

- Diagnosing signal issues without a meter, because you left it 45 minutes away
- Crawling 200 ft under a house just to find out there is, in fact, nothing there
- How to stare at a ceiling, and get a flash of divine certainty: *"someone did something stupid up there in 1988. I must go there."*
* Explain BERs and SNRs to "an engineer" who absolutely knows More Than You.

These are the kinds of lessons that *actually* teach systems thinking if you're
paying attention.
You get the ability to see beyond the JSON payload; and the deeper reality-
all of this is just dumb rocks we tricked into wiggling a certain way.

It teaches some perspective, and probably a bit of arrogance.

- Assume the worst
- Don't forget where you put your tools
- The last guy definitely didn't do it right
- Oh... I see why they did that.
- The last guy was you.
- It's still your problem.

If you've never:
- Dug six feet of snow and ice to find a pedastal
- Wrung a quantifiable amount of sweat out of your shirt after being in an attic for 10 minutes
- Or gazed into the blinking sync LED wondering where your life went wrong

You have not become *one with the stack.* Embrace the phy.
